          <blockquote>
            Amberlea tennis club has only 2 courts and many active members.
            Members may have to wait for a court to become available. It is
            therefore very important that members know the rules and follow
            them. <br />
            Court rules are posted on the website and at the courts. Amberlea
            Tennis Clubs activities such as league play, tournaments, etc
            override these rules. <br />Information about club activities is
            indicated on the court usage calendar that is available on the
            website and at the courts. While efforts are made to keep the court
            usage calendar up to date, sometimes errors and omissions may occur.

          <h2>How Does Court Usage Work?</h2>
          <p>
            When members are waiting to play, the members on the court should
            leave on the ½ hour (i.e. 8:30, 9:00, and 9:30).
          </p>
          <p>
            If they just started playing, then they would come off at the next ½
            hour interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the members have been playing for 30 minutes already, they should
            leave the courts and let the waiting members play.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the courts are busy, you can expect to play for 30 minutes and
            wait for 30 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who should leave the courts first when members are waiting to play?
            The members who have been on the courts the longest should leave
            first. This applies to all types of matches: singles, doubles,
            adults and kids. Remember that Club events override this rule.
