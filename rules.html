          <blockquote>
            Amberlea tennis club has only 2 courts and many active members.
            Members may have to wait for a court to become available. It is
            therefore very important that members know the rules and follow
            them. <br />
            Court rules are posted on the website and at the courts. Amberlea
            Tennis Clubs activities such as league play, tournaments, etc
            override these rules. <br />Information about club activities is
            indicated on the court usage calendar that is available on the
            website and at the courts. While efforts are made to keep the court
            usage calendar up to date, sometimes errors and omissions may occur.

          <h2>How Does Court Usage Work?</h2>
          <!-- <p>
            When members are waiting to play, the members on the court should
            leave on the ½ hour (i.e. 8:30, 9:00, and 9:30).
          </p>
          <p>
            If they just started playing, then they would come off at the next ½
            hour interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the members have been playing for 30 minutes already, they should
            leave the courts and let the waiting members play.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the courts are busy, you can expect to play for 30 minutes and
            wait for 30 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who should leave the courts first when members are waiting to play?
            The members who have been on the courts the longest should leave
            first. This applies to all types of matches: singles, doubles,
            adults and kids. Remember that Club events override this rule.
          </p> -->
          <p>
            NEW Court RULES: in order to make the rule regarding when one can
            play and the duration of play as simple and as clear as possible,
            the following new rule will apply:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>time allotted for play is 1 (one) hour per session</li>
            <li>
              the 1 hour start/ends either on the hour or on the half hour.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Examples:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>I start playing at 1pm. I need to leave the court at 2pm</li>
            <li>
              I start playing at 1:15pm. I need to leave the court at 2pm.
            </li>
            <li>
              I start playing at 12:30pm. I need to leave the court at 1:30pm
            </li>
            <li>
              I start playing at 12:45pm, I need to leave the court by 1:30pm
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The court with the gate will be the “hour” court; the one closest to
            the soccer fields, the “half hour” court.
          </p>
          <p>Also, there will be a “bonus” period of 5 minutes. This means:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              If I arrive at 12:45 and the courts are empty, I start playing. At
              12:55, people show up to play at 1pm.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless a compromise can be reached by all players concerned, the
              people arriving at 12:55 should get priority to the courts at 1pm.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There will need to be honesty and fair-play by all members,
            especially for those who are waiting to play.

            Amberlea Tennis Club strives to provide a safe, welcoming and positive environment/ atmosphere for the members, programs and facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a club for all players regardless of playing ability, and the focus is on recreational tennis and having fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The courts, including the practice court, are to be used for their intended purpose, namely playing tennis and nothing else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Active members are allowed to play with guests up to 3 times a season without a membership. After that, guests are strongly encouraged to join.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the diversity of the membership and the location of the courts, i.e. in Shadybrook Park and in close proximity to a school and playground, all members and guests are expected to conduct themselves on and off the courts in a dignified manner and display sportsmanship at all times.  The goal is to encourage a community in which individuals are treated with respect, dignity and fairness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of profanities, threatening language and/or violent gestures towards anyone as well as racquet abuse will not be tolerated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Executive takes the above very seriously and any violation of these as well as the court rules will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 
            Depending on the severity, actions can range from a written warning to the expulsion from the club.
          </p>
          <p>

              Note: Amberlea Tennis Club and its members and guests will also abide by the City of Pickering’s “Zero Tolerance Policy” at all times.
